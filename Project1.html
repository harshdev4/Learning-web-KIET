	<h1>My Introduction</h1>
	<h2 style="font-weight:500;">Hi, my name is Harsh!!</h2>
	<p style="font-size:18px;">I have completed my Bachelor's Of Computer Application from CSJMU in 2024. Now I'm pursuing Master's Of Computer Application from KIET, Ghaziabad.</p>

	<p style="font-size:18px;">I'm really passionate about web and app development. I have already build some full-stack projects with MERN-STACK.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Currently, I'm exploring React Native to strengthen my mobile app development skill.</p>
	<p style="font-size:18px;">Over the next two years, I will upskill myself to become a skilled full-stack developer and will also work on my communication skills.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:50px; text-align:center; font-weight:400;">That's a little brief about me.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Thank You!</p>
